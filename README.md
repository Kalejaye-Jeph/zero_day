# My First Repository as a Full-Stack Engineer

Welcome to my first repository on GitHub! This repository is part of my learning journey as a full-stack engineer. Here, I'll be completing various tasks and projects to enhance my skills and knowledge.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific project or task. Here's a quick overview:

### 0x00-vagrant

In this directory, you'll find the solution to the "Hello Ubuntu" task. I've SSHed into an Ubuntu virtual machine and used the `uname` command to answer a question. The answer is stored in the file `0-hello_ubuntu`.

## About Me

I'm currently enrolled in a software engineering program and based in Nigeria. I'm excited to explore the world of coding and development, and this repository is where I'll be documenting my progress.

Feel free to explore the different directories and files in this repository to see what I've been working on. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

This project is part of the ALX School's curriculum. It's 100% optional and allows me to learn and practice important concepts in a hands-on manner.
